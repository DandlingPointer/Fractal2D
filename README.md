#Fractal2D

This is a simple javafx application, in which you can create fractals through Lua-Code. At the moment it's very WIP

###TODOs

* Canvas resize
* ~~Accordion should never be collapsed [Stack Overflow Question regarding this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10403838/prevent-an-accordion-in-javafx-from-collapsing)~~
* Syntax highlighting when using interactive mode
* Draw area should expand witht he window
* Zoom
* Better error handling, and user informing
* returning the values in lua doesn't work, use globals r,g,b instead!
